# Weather-App-Python<br>

Hello, I developed a Weather App in Python using tkinter.<br>
<br>

Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python.<br> Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.<br> Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.<br>

The main modules used for building this application are:-<br>**1.Requests<br>2.Time**<br>


This application fetches the weather with the help of an API.<br>
Input has to be a City name, it'll give you the Weather of that particular location.<br>
It along with the Temperature will also give give you the Sunrise time, Sunset time, Wind Speed etc...<br>
<br>


Voila!!!



Here's a glimpse on my Project.<br>
